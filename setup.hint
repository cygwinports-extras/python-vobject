ldesc: "vobject is intended to be a full featured Python package for 
parsing and generating vCard and vCalendar files. Currently, iCalendar 
files are supported and well tested. vCard 3.0 files are supported, and 
all data should be imported, but only a few components are understood in 
a sophisticated way."
